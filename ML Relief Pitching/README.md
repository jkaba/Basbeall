# ML Relief Pitching

This project uses Machine Learning to try and predict when a pitcher will give up a run.

The model is trained on data obtained from Retrosheet and the Lahman database

Files:
- constants.py - Contains Parameter Grids used
- data_in.py - Takes in data from .csv files and databases
- exploration.py - Calculates the rate for how often a pitcher will give up a run
- helpers.py - File that contains Cleaning and Preprocessing Functions.
- classification.py - Contains Machine Learning Training Functons
- main.py - Contains the Main Method/Function
