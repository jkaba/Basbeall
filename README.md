This repo will be the home to Baseball projects which I have done on my own.
This ReadMe will be updated as files get uploaded.

PredictedBatAvg.py: 
- This is a Neural Network project in which given Exit Velocity and Launch Angles as User Inputs a Neural Network trained on StatCast data will produce the estimated batting average and slugging percentage.

play_validation.py
- A method which validates whether or not a transition from one game state to another can validly occur as a play. For this method, a "play" is the period from one instance when a pitcher has the ball and may legally pitch to either the next such instance or the end of a half-inning. 

PredictedPlayerStats.py
- This is an extension of the PredictedBatAvg.py program. A user inputs a player's first and last name to the program which the Neural Network trained on StatCast data will return an estimated batting average and slugging percentage based on this players StatCast data.
