Home for Baseball Projects

This repo will be the home to Baseball projects which I have done on my own.
This ReadMe will be updated as files get uploaded.

MLB_Attendance.r
- This R program was used for an analysis in regards to MLB Attendance, and looks into potentially factors which could affect attendance. 

PitcherData.py
- This program is meant to be used as a tool to compare a pitcher's pitch data before and after a specified date. This program takes as user input a pitcher's first and last name, as well as two date ranges to compare data, and returns a plot of the pitcher's pitch data as well as a data table with info such as Speed, Release Extension, Break, Exit Velocity, and Launch Angle. 

PlayValidation.py
- A method which validates whether or not a transition from one game state to another can validly occur as a play. For this method, a "play" is the period from one instance when a pitcher has the ball and may legally pitch to either the next such instance or the end of a half-inning. 

PredictedBatAvg.py: 
- This is a Neural Network project in which given Exit Velocity and Launch Angles as User Inputs a Neural Network trained on StatCast data will produce the estimated batting average and slugging percentage.

PredictedPlayerStats.py
- This is an extension of the PredictedBatAvg.py program. A user inputs a player's first and last name to the program which the Neural Network trained on StatCast data will return an estimated batting average and slugging percentage based on this players StatCast data.
