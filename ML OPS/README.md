# ML OPS

This project, uses Machine Learning to try and predict a players OPS rating for the upcoming season. 

At this point in time 2019 data is not available yet, so 2018 is used. When 2019 data becomes available I plan on coming back to this project

OPS is defined as On base percentage + Slugging percentage

Data used for OPS Modeling
- Offensive stats from the previous 5 seasons
- Postseason offensive stats from previous season
- The previous seasons team, primary positions, and awards
- Models are trained on data from 2000 - 2018 using the Lahman database.
